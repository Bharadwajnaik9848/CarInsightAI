# CarInsightAI
This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform that provides detailed information on both brand-new and used cars available in the USA, along with their insurance details. The system will aggregate and display essential car specifications, pricing, and insurance options, helping users make informed decisions before purchasing a vehicle.
